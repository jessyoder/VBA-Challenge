# VBA-Challenge
Using VBA Scripting to analyze real stock market data

* I createe a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information.

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

* I added conditional formatting that highlights positive change in green and negative change in red.

* I created a table to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease" and "Greatest total volume".
